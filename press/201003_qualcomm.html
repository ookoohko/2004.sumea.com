      <p class="topicnews">LEADING EUROPEAN PUBLISHER SUMEA EXPANDS AVAILABILITY OF AWARD-WINNING<br>
        WIRELESS GAMES TO OPERATORS OFFERING BREW&#8482; SERVICES WORLDWIDE<br>
        Finnish Mobile Entertainment Powerhouse Announces Roster of BREW-based Games</p>
      <p>Sumea, an award-winning game
        publisher, today announced three of its most popular, premium wireless
        game titles, developed for QUALCOMM&#8217;s Binary Runtime Environment
        for Wireless&#8482; (BREW) platform, are available for operators that
        have deployed BREW-based products and services. Users will soon be able
        to play and enjoy Yo-Yo Fighter, Fantasy Warrior and Racing Fever 2 on
        their BREW-enabled handsets.</p>
      <p>The three popular titles include:</p>
	  <p><img src="../img/arrow1.gif" width="15" height="8"> Yo-Yo Fighter &#8212; A
        platform-style game in which the player controls the hero Yozo in his
        attempt to rescue his friend Jaco who is lost on
        the World of Stone. The game features a total of 17 action-packed levels
        with plenty of obstacles to negotiate and lots of baddies to slay...
        with a yo-yo! Superb graphics, a great storyline and the odd cheat or
        two, make the game play of this new title totally addictive and captivating
        for a wide audience.</p>
      <p><img src="../img/arrow1.gif" width="15" height="8"> Fantasy Warrior &#8212; A
        story-driven, role-play adventure game with multiple characters, monsters,
        dungeons and collectable items, in which
        the player controls a boy called Rento, the hero. Rento must find a way
        to dispel the sealed dungeon&#8217;s spell while doing favors for people
        along the way who can help in his quest. By practicing Rento&#8217;s
        fighting skills with fearless sword masters and collecting uniquely mysterious
        artifacts, you will finally get to meet the fearsome demons and cyclops
        who guard the gate to the Mountain of Darkness.</p>
      <p><img src="../img/arrow1.gif" width="15" height="8"> Racing
        Fever 2 &#8212; This
        sequel to Racing Fever&#151;Sumea&#8217;s
        most famous game to date and the benchmark for mobile racing games&#151;includes
        multiple tracks, road types, weather conditions and opponent drivers.
        The objective in Racing Fever 2 is to drive better and faster
        than your current opponent to unlock the next track. But you&#8217;d
        better make sure that you don&#8217;t collide with slower cars on the
        road, as this will slow you right down!</p>      <p>&#8220;We currently offer some of the most popular wireless games available
        today to users in more than 40 countries worldwide,&#8221; said Ilkka
        Paananen, CEO of Sumea. &#8220;By expanding our wireless footprint to
        include BREW-based content, we are effectively opening the doors to new
        revenue possibilities around the world. We have been impressed with the
        BREW system and all of the products and services it provides to assist
        our team with the development and deployment of our top wireless content.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;The decision by Sumea, a widely renowned wireless game publisher,
        to develop its content for the BREW platform speaks volumes about the
        support we have received from the European development community,&#8221; said
        Mike Yuen, director, BREW Developer Relations, QUALCOMM Internet Services. &#8220;We&#8217;re
        glad to have Sumea come on board, as one of our primary goals is to continue
        to grow and empower our international development community with the
        distribution of their BREW-based applications to operators around the
        globe.&#8221;</p>

        that connect the mobile marketplace value chain, which includes application
        developers, publishers, content providers, device manufacturers, operators and
