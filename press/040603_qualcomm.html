      <p class="topicnews">SUMEA ADDS SIX NEW TITLES TO ITS BREW&#8482;-BASED WIRELESS
        GAME PORTFOLIO</p>
      <p>HELSINKI, FINLAND (June 03, 2004) &#151; Sumea Interactive, Inc., an
        award-winning publisher and developer of high-quality, downloadable mobile games, today
        announced the addition of six new games developed for QUALCOMM&#8217;s BREW solution.
        All titles are expected to be available for distribution by Summer 2004.</p>
      <p>Sumea&#8217;s Summer 2004 BREW-based portfolio will consist of the following games:</p>
      <p><strong>Yoyo Fighter</strong> &#151; Players must find their way around 18 action-packed
        levels to save helpless friend Jaco who has been captured by the Golem
        Boss. The only weapon to use is a yoyo.</p>
      <p><strong>Mafia Wars</strong> &#151; A story-driven action game that takes place in
        1920s New York. Mafia Wars combines exciting strategic elements that force
        players to think twice about whether to rush straight into the enemy
        field or choose an alternative path of action. </p>
      <p><strong>Extreme Air Snowboarding</strong> &#151; An action-packed winter sports game
        with smooth 3D graphics and multiple game modes. </p>
      <p><strong>Pitfall: The Lost Expedition</strong> &#151; This game series is a proven
        franchise by Activision, where players control fearless adventurer Harry
        as he explores the jungle, a glacier and caves. </p>
      <p><strong>Racing Fever 2</strong> &#151; This game features multiple tracks with different
        weather conditions. The player commences racing when the sun is setting,
        continues through the rainy night and ends at dawn. </p>
      <p><strong>Jumbo Rumble</strong> &#151; This is a multiplayer game where up to 3 players
        compete against each other, either in melee or tag fight mode. The game
        is played on a single device, where each player controls the elephant
        with only one key. </p>
      <p>&#8220;We plan to continue to extend our line-up of mobile games based
        on the BREW solution so that we can reach millions of new players worldwide,&#8221; said
        Ilkka Paananen, CEO of Sumea. &#8220;We are also constantly thinking
