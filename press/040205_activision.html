      <p class="topicnews">SUMEA SIGNS LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH ACTIVISION FOR MOBILE GAMES<br>
        Sumea set to publish Activision&#8217;s highly-anticipated action adventure
        title Pitfall&reg;: The Lost Expedition&#8482; for Java and Brew mobile
        gaming platforms</p>
      <p>Sumea announced today that the company has signed an agreement to license
        Activision, Inc.&#8217;s upcoming multi-platform game Pitfall&reg;: The
        Lost Expedition&#8482; for mobile gaming platforms. The Pitfall mobile
        games will be set in jungle, glacier and cave worlds from the console
        game, and deliver a rich episodic gaming experience through three distinct
        downloadable games set in each of these environments.</p>
      <p>Activision will release Pitfall: The Lost Expedition for the PlayStation&reg;2
        computer entertainment system, the Xbox&reg; video game system from Microsoft,
        Nintendo GameCube&#8482;, and Game Boy&reg; Advance in February 2004.
        Sumea will release the first episode of the Pitfall: The Lost Expedition
        mobile game, The Jungle, simultaneously with the console game to guarantee
        a true multi-platform game release. In addition, the mobile version is
        linked to the console game through unlockable cheat codes.</p>
      <p>The first episode of Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, challenges players
        to locate a legendary artifact that is guarded by a Giant Monkey. The
        adventure takes place in distinct locales including jungles, swamps,
        under water, and ancient ruins. The game features 16 levels in which
        players swing on vines, jump on crocodiles, swim, dive and sling rocks
        to defeat dangerous enemies.</p>
      <p>The Glacier and Caves episodes are targeted for release in April and
        May 2004. All three mobile game episodes will be widely available through
        Sumea&#8217;s extensive distribution network in the U.S. and Europe,
        and through wide mobile handset support.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Our partnership with Sumea will successfully bring one of Activision&#8217;s
        proven franchises, Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, to the mobile gaming
        market,&#8221; said Dave Anderson, Senior Director of Business Development
        for Activision, Inc. &#8220;The ability to unlock console cheat codes
        by playing the mobile game delivers an enriching cross-platform gaming
        experience.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Activision is one of the leading publishers in the interactive
        entertainment industry and we are very proud to work with them. We believe
        this partnership is a perfect match: Activision has excellent brands
        and expertise from traditional console games, whereas Sumea can leverage
        its extensive distribution channels and top-notch talent in game design
        to deliver high-quality mobile gaming experiences. We strongly believe
        this is a great way to enrich our current product portfolio and will
        provide added value to our customers and gamers.&#8221; said Ilkka Paananen,
        CEO of Sumea.</p>
