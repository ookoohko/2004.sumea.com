      <p class="topicnews">Orange Denmark chose Sumea's Java games</p>
      <p>Finnish mobile entertainment powerhouse Sumea now has four mobile Java 
        games available through Orange Denmark (DK). The games are Racing Fever, 
        Zoy's Rescue, Staqqer and Amoebas.</p>
      <p>Orange is yet another impressive addition to Sumea's customer base. Orange 
        DK wanted to test the Danish mobile telephone market with quality Java 
        applications and Sumea matched their high expectations. People at Orange 
        DK were very much aware that the customer's first encounter with a new 
        technology must be a positive one.</p>
      <p>&quot;From day one we were thrilled by the quality of the games Sumea 
        provided. The design was of a very high quality, user-friendly, and the 
        games themselves very intuitive to play&quot;, says Product Manager Tomas 
        Volf from Orange DK.</p>
      <p>At present, the deal consists of four distinct games. Racing Fever is 
        a street racing game and is so far the most popular game in Sumea's product 
        portfolio. There is also a lot of action in Zoy's Rescue Mission &#151; an 
        adventure game where one must save the juniors that have crash-landed 
        on Iceplanet. Staqqer and Amoabas are aimed at those who look for more 
        intellectually stimulating recreational activities. Both games are unique 
        brainteasers and are reminiscent of old PC favourites like Tetris.</p>
      <p>The market is now stuffed with mobile Java Games, but only a handful 
        of applications stand out in the crowd. In this kind of environment, Sumea's 
        dedication to create quality entertainment has been well received. Like 
        most of Sumea's customers, Orange is looking forward to add more of Sumea's 
        games to its service offering.</p>
      <p>&quot;For Sumea the past few months have been hectic. It's been great 
        to see that our global customers seem to share the same values that we 
        have for mobile games. In the future we aim to foster our position as 
        a company that sets the (industry) standards&quot;, promises Ilkka Paananen, 
        CEO of Sumea.</p>
