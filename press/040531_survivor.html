      <p class="topicnews">SUMEA TO LAUNCH SURVIVOR MOBILE GAME FOR THE NEW NOKIA 3220<br>
        Become the World&#8217;s First Mobile Survivor<br>
        Castaway&#8217;s International TV Hit Transits into Sumea&#8217;s Survivor
        Mobile Game</p>
      <p>HELSINKI, FINLAND (May 31, 2004) &#151; Sumea Interactive today announced
        the launch of the Survivor mobile game, based on Castaway Television
        Productions&#8217; international hit TV show Survivor. Castaway has granted
        Sumea exclusive rights to Survivor-branded mobile games throughout EMEA,
        Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Sumea&#8217;s Survivor mobile game includes
        the all-embracing adventure aspects of the Survivor format, featuring
        exceptionally smooth gameplay and amazing graphics. The game will be
        available in Q3, 2004 exclusively at <a href="http://www.nokia.com/shop" target="_blank">www.nokia.com/shop</a> and at Nokia
        Software Market, <a href="http://www.softwaremarket.nokia.com" target="_blank">www.softwaremarket.nokia.com</a>.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Proving their creativity and gaming design expertise, Sumea have
        brought the Survivor TV brand into a compelling, visually intriguing
        and easy-to-learn mobile game. The Survivor mobile game is ideally positioned
        to attract millions of casual gamers worldwide,&#8221; said Julia Dick,
        Business Developer of Castaway Television Productions Ltd.</p>
      <p>&#8220;We are very excited to make Sumea&#8217;s Survivor game an integral
        part of the unique launch of the Nokia 3220 camera phone, which is targeted
        to mobile-savvy young adults. We believe that a true breakthrough in
        mobile gaming requires a combination of a widely-known international
        brand, an appealing format, an effective distribution channel, a strong
        marketing partnership and superior quality with an easy-to-learn and
        highly playable interface. The Survivor mobile game has all these in
        place,&#8221; said Ilkka Paananen, CEO of Sumea Interactive Ltd.</p>
	  <p>The Survivor mobile game has three game modes: career, single challenge
        and hot-seat multiplayer. In career mode, the player takes on a variety
        of challenges to win immunity in the tribal council voting. Another
        way to avoid being eliminated from the competition is to gain respect
        by collecting food for the tribe and by forming alliances with other
        members. The eight challenges are visually impressive and easy-to-play
        mini-games. In single game mode, the player can select one of the mini-games
        to improve his/her high-score or to practice. The unique hot-seat multiplayer
        mode allows players to compete against friends using a single device.</p>
      <p>&#8220;We are committed to serving different types of gamers with a
        series of high-quality mobile games. Sumea games are created by engineers,
        concept designers and game developers who take pride in understanding
        how traditional board and card games capture our hearts. Gaming must
        be simple, fun and, above all, stripped of technical restraints. Survivor
        marks the beginning of a series of Sumea games we currently have in development,&#8221; said
        Ilkka Paananen, CEO of Sumea Interactive Ltd.</p>
      <p>Sumea has also licensed Survivor-themed ringtones, logos and wallpapers.
        The Survivor mobile game will become available through Sumea&#8217;s
        operator partners in March 2005.</p>
