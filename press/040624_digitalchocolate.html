        LEADING EUROPEAN MOBILE GAMES PUBLISHER<br>
        U.S.-based Start-up Expands Distribution
        Reach to Europe, Gains Strong Management and Premium Titles</p>
      <p>SAN MATEO, CA and HELSINKI, FINLAND, June 24, 2004 &#151; Digital Chocolate, Inc., a developer
        of innovative software for mobile phones founded by software gaming pioneer
        Trip Hawkins, today announced it has acquired Sumea, a leading European
        developer and publisher of high-quality games for mobile phones. </p>
      <p>The acquisition provides Digital Chocolate with relationships with some
        of the world&#8217;s largest wireless carriers, international distribution
        channels, and a catalog of leading games for mobile phones. Terms of
        the acquisition were not disclosed. Digital Chocolate applications will
        be available through major U.S. wireless carriers later this summer.</p>
      <p>Digital Chocolate develops and publishes innovative applications for
        mobile phones, including games, lifestyle and social networking applications.
        The company&#8217;s CEO and founder, Trip Hawkins, has a notable history
        in gaming software, having founded and built the seminal games company
        Electronic Arts. Founded in December 2003, Digital Chocolate is backed
        by Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield &amp; Byers and Sequoia Capital, as well
        as individual investors, including Bob Pittman, former COO of AOL/Time
        Warner and founder of MTV. </p>
      <p>Sumea was originally founded in 1999 and focuses on creating high quality,
        innovative and technically superior games for major wireless platforms.
        Sumea is based in Helsinki, Finland and has some of the world&#8217;s
        leading wireless carriers as customers and partners, including Vodafone,
        O2, Orange, AT&amp;T Wireless, T-Mobile, and Cingular Wireless. Sumea&#8217;s
        Mafia Wars and Racing Fever games are among the leading games on some
        of the industry&#8217;s most prominent carriers.</p>
      <p> &#8220;Acquiring Sumea provides Digital Chocolate with strong, established
        partnerships with major global carriers, broad geographic distribution
        and an entire catalog of top-rated games,&#8221; said Trip Hawkins, CEO
        of Digital Chocolate. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Our mission is to enhance the everyday experience for the millions
        of people on the world&#8217;s most ubiquitous computing platform. Sumea&#8217;s
        24 titles, great carrier relationships and industry leadership get us
        closer to that goal,&#8221; he continued.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Sumea brings a highly talented management team that has built
        a profitable and innovative company. They&#8217;ve developed and launched
        some of the most popular games in the world,&#8221; said Mark Jacobstein,
        president and COO of Digital Chocolate. &#8220;Digital Chocolate will
        be global and mobile, and now we&#8217;re set to launch in Europe with
        one of the best organizations on the continent.&#8221;</p>
      <p>The merged entity will have relationships with over 110 distribution
        partners in more than 53 countries on five continents. Digital Chocolate
        plans to retain the Sumea brand for existing Sumea titles and expand
        the distribution of those titles in the U.S., as well as leverage the
        existing Sumea channels internationally to support upcoming Digital Chocolate
        applications.</p>
      <p>&#8220;At Sumea we are very excited about working with Digital Chocolate
        and industry veterans like Trip Hawkins toward a common, immediate goal
        of developing and publishing high quality games that change the way people
        think about and use their mobile phones.&#8221; said Ilkka Paananen,
        CEO of Sumea. &#8220;This merger will also offer increased access to
        new financial and development resources that will bring greater value
        to Sumea&#8217;s current customers.&#8221;</p>
