It's race time! All of the most furious mad caps are in town, so let's rock 'n' roll! Racing Fever 2 is the official sequel to Sumea's most famous game to date, which by now can be considered as the benchmark for mobile racing games.

The game features multiple tracks with different weather conditions. Racing commences when the sun is setting, continues through the rainy night and ends at dawn. The objective in Racing Fever 2 is to drive better and faster than your current opponent to unlock the next track. Collect power-ups to overtake slower cars and show the hardest drivers who's the new boss in town! If you find ordinary overtaking too easy, you can always find your way to the ramps and jump over obstacles or other cars.

Put the pedal to the metal and burn some rubber once again!
