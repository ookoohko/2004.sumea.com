--------------------------

Welcome to sumea::singlecell project.

The creature in "It Came from the Petri Dish" is
a hopping metablob generated by YOU in the role
of a cruel mad scientist. By selecting and combining
various fragments of seed DNA, you can shape a
creature's form as well as the way it moves.

Fortunately, some of the creatures are bred to be
self-destructive, just in case an escape situation
arises with a dangerous mutation... The creature
explodes if it touches the edge of the petri dish.

The creature is some sort of "metablob" which is
constructed from user-defined DNA parameters.

Drag DNA blocks with the tweezers to the center of
the petri dish. Blocks are automatically arranged 
in clockwise combinations. You can re-arrange
or remove the blocks in the dish. After combining
seven DNA blocks, wait for five seconds without
moving the mouse and your creature will born... 

DNA codes currently have parameters like:

- Creature look and abilities
- Walking speed and type
- Jump types and lengths
- A "bad mutation" code which suddenly just melts
  the creature
- Hyperactivity
- IQ

Singlecell August uses version 2.0 of sumea::engine
and it's designed to be run on newer PC platforms.
More information about sumea::engine can be found
at www.sumea.com

Minimum recommendation is 600mhz PC, with
preferrably Pentium III or AMD Athlon processor.
